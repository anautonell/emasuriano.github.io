# Ema Suriano Portfolio

Hi ðŸ‘‹ This is my personal portfolio where I write a bit about me, the stuff I've worked and all the related links of me.

The idea is to upload it to Gatsby template in the near future, in the meantime you can fork it.

## Technologies used

- React
- Gatsby
- Rebass (Styled-components system)
