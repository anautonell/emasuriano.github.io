Hi everybody! :wave: I'm really happy to announce the starting of my own blog inside my new fresh portfolio :heart_eyes:. As I was re-thinking my portfolio, the idea of adding a blog had raised and I couldn't keep it out of my head. I'm always looking for new ways to share knowledge and I think that this will be an excellent option to try.

![Hello World!](./1.jpg)

The idea of creating a blog came up when I was talking with a new co-worker in my current job, I was explaining a problem that we had on a previous project and how we solved it, then he asked if I had any blog or site where I had written something about it and my answer was a shy no :disappointed:. At first, I didn't like the idea because of the amount of time that it will take me, but after leaving work the only thing I was thinking about was to create a blog :joy:

So what will I write down here? Only the stuff that I think that other developers would find helpful for them or at least interesting. It could be how I solved a specific problem with a framework, from how to set up running a project in X technology.

Talking about the periodicity of the post, I can't promise anything. As I said, I will upload new post whenever I have something worth sharing, I like to think that quality matters more than quantity.

With nothing more to say, I hope you like this blog :pray:
